### Build Your Own Shell 🐚

Even though [CodeCrafters.io](https://app.codecrafters.io/) is ~~a bit~~ way "out of my league" it is still one of my favorite websites. And what other way to up your skill level than to learn from the pros?

This challenge is about coding your own **POSIX compliant shell**. Once completed I plan to take it a step further and add some additional features and maybe even turn it into something more or different. And in the process, learn a lot more about how shells work.

All that being said, with 40+ stages this is gonna take a while for sure 😅...will be fun though....


#### Example Output for the `type builtin: builtins #ez5` stage

```bash
$ ./my_shell
$ echo i luv codecrafters
i luv codecrafters
$ type exit
exit is a 🐚 builtin
$ type type
type is a 🐚 builtin
$ type echo
echo is a 🐚 builtin
$ type cats
cats: not found
$ exit
```
