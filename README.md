### Build Your Own Shell 🐚

Even though [CodeCrafters.io](https://app.codecrafters.io/) is a bit "out of my league" it is one of my favorite websites. And what other way to up your skill level than to learn from the pros?

This challenge is about coding your own **POSIX compliant shell**. Once completed, I plan to take it a step further and add some additional features and maybe even turn it into 
something more or different. And in the process, learn a lot more about how shells work.

#### Example Output

```bash
$ ./my_shell
$ echo i luv codecrafters
i luv codecrafters
$ type exit
exit is a 🐚 builtin
$ type type
type is a 🐚 builtin
$ type echo
echo is a 🐚 builtin
$ type cats
cats: not found
$ exit
```
